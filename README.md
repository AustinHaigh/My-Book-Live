## Reading and writing u-boot environment flash from Debian Jessie ##
How to avoid opening the My Book Live shell in case a boot failure:
* (low-level) format the embedded hard drive
* u-boot fails to boot from harddisk 

One of the requirements to make this all work is the ability to read/write the u-boot environment stored in nor flash from the OS, which is stored within /dev/mtd0.

First install u-boot-tools:
`apt-get install u-boot-tools`

Then create /etc/fw_env.config:

`cat >/etc/fw_env.config <<EOF`<br />
`/dev/mtd0 0x1e000 0x1000 0x1000 1`<br /> 
`/dev/mtd0 0x1f000 0x1000 0x1000 1`<br /> 
`EOF`

Now you can check your environment: 
`fw_printenv`
And set a variable: 
`fw_setenv variable value`

In this way a running operation system can feedback to u-boot that booting has successfully completed and there is no need to try a fallback boot image.  Additionally, it could fallback on TFTP/BOOTP boot.
