# My-Book-Live Device Tree Structure

## Compiled Tree structure ##

Use the compiled apollo3g.dtd for now on MBL and apollo3g_duo.dtd on MBL Duo.
Please note that Duo versions are not validated by myself.

## Compiling a DTS source structure
The provided script "ktdtc.sh" will compile apollo3g.dtd and apollo3g_duo.dtd from sources apollo3g.dts and apollo3g_duo.dts

## DTS sources

Will provide .dts sources when I have the time to document.
